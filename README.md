# How to play

Click on a piece to select it.
Click on the square where you want to move the piece.
If the move is valid, the piece will move to the new square.
If the move is not valid, the piece will remain in its current square.
To win the game, you must checkmate the other king. Checkmate is when the king is in a position where it can be captured and there is no way to escape.

# Tips for playing against the AI

The AI is very good at finding and exploiting weaknesses in your position. Be careful not to leave any pieces undefended.
The AI is also very good at planning ahead. Try to think several moves ahead and anticipate the AI's moves.
Don't be afraid to sacrifice pieces if it means improving your position or gaining an advantage.
